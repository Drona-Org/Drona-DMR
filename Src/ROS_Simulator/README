Quadrotor Simulation in ROS (for groovy and newer)

1. do "rosmake" for each package to create the binary on your computer
for example,
"rosmake map_visualization"
"rosmake mesh_visualization"
...

2. To start the simulator, first run
"roslaunch quadrotor_simulator test.launch"

This will start the simulation in RVIZ. The current configuration file is compatible with ROS groovy and newer only.

The start location of each quadrotor is specified inside test.launch (in quadrotor_simulator/launch folder).
This package depends on quadrotor_msgs for getting quadrotor command, map_visualzation for getting map info, and mesh_visualization for model of quadrotor.

To change the map, you can change the input file inside test.launch on the map_visualzation node.

3. To control the quadrotor in the simulator, run
"roslaunch quad_controller test.launch"
The desire position of each quad for hovering is define inside test.launch (in quad_controller/launch folder). This doesn't take into account of the internal collision. It simply do two steps: take of to desired height and move in stright line to the desire position.
At this point the quadrotor will hover about the desire position and waiting for new trajectory.
NOTE: The quadrotor will land in not receiving any inputs for a certain amount of time. (specify inside test.launch as time/land)

4. To send new trajectory to the quadrotor, you need to publish trajectory data to trajectoryinfo that quad_trajectory node subscribe to. These numbers are part of the motion primitive. I briefly start the primitive handler that take care of parsing yaml file. To get the trajectory from the input file depends is not very complicated. I will put some example on that laters.
